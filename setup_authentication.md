## Introduction

Welcome to the concise guide on setting up authentication in Version Control Systems (VCS). In today's digital age, securing your version control is essential for safeguarding your code and fostering collaborative development. This documentation provides streamlined instructions and best practices for configuring authentication mechanisms across various VCS platforms, ensuring your projects remain protected while enabling seamless teamwork. Let's dive in and strengthen the security of your version control infrastructure.

## Pre-requisites

- Active Gmail Account

- Any TOTP authenticator app installed on your device (e.g. Google Authenticator )

- Device to scan QR for passkey

## Setup guide

### Step-I

- In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

  



## Advantages

| Name | Description |
| :-------: | ------- |
|**Security Enhancement**| Authentication setups prevent unauthorized access to your code repositories, reducing the risk of data breaches, intellectual property theft, and malicious activities.|
|**User Accountability****| By requiring authentication for accessing VCS, you establish accountability among team members. Each action taken within the system is traceable to specific users, fostering a culture of responsibility and transparency.|
|**Access Control**| Authentication allows you to enforce granular access controls, specifying who can view, modify, or manage repositories and their contents. This ensures that sensitive information remains accessible only to authorized personnel.
|**Regulatory Compliance**| Authentication mechanisms help ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards by maintaining an auditable record of code changes and user interactions. This is particularly crucial in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and government.|
|**Streamlined Collaboration**| Secure authentication facilitates seamless collaboration among team members, regardless of their geographical location or organizational role. Team members can confidently share code, review changes, and collaborate on projects in real-time.|
|**Integration Flexibility**| Many authentication methods integrate seamlessly with existing identity providers (IdPs), enabling centralized user management and simplifying access control administration. This streamlines user provisioning and deprovisioning processes, reducing administrative overhead|


## Disadvantages

| Name | Description |
| :-------: | -------- |
|**Complexity and Overhead**| Depending on the authentication method chosen, implementation and maintenance can introduce complexity and administrative overhead.|
|**User Resistance**| Introducing authentication requirements, especially if they involve additional steps like multi-factor authentication (MFA) or complex password policies, can lead to user resistance or frustration. |
|**Single Point of Failure**| If authentication mechanisms are not properly configured or maintained, they can become single points of failure. Any compromise or downtime in the authentication system could lead to widespread access issues and disrupt development workflows.|
|**User Experience Impact**| Stringent authentication measures, such as frequent password changes or complex authentication processes, may negatively impact user experience.
|**Integration Challenges**| Integrating authentication systems with existing |infrastructure or third-party services can present challenges, particularly in heterogeneous environments with diverse technologies and protocols.|
